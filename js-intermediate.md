# ASSESSMENT 3: INTERMEDIATE JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What are the HTTP verbs? Which CRUD action corresponds to each verb?

  Your answer: get(read), post(create), delete(delete), patch/put(update)

  Researched answer: The HTTP verbs comprise a major portion of our “uniform interface” constraint and provide us the action counterpart to the noun-based resource. The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently.


2. Why would you use object destructuring?

  Your answer: If you're going to use an object over and over

  Researched answer: The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.



3. Why is testing important?

  Your answer: It's important to test code to prevent future failures and bugs that may come up.

  Researched answer:
                    Until you execute a line of code, you don't know if that line can work at all. Until you execute your code with a representative set of basic use cases, you don't know if the code can work end-to-end.
                    If you and possibly other people are going to modify your code, it's very easy to break it in unexpected ways. A suite of automated unit and integration tests gives you confidence you've not broken anything significant. Tests can be used for profiling, to help you understand changes in your system's performance, and raise a flag if something degrades significantly.



4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: The way that they are written.

  Researched answer:The most obvious difference is the syntax. A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element. This requires more code but will also give you some benefits which you will see later on


5. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

  Your answer: I learned how to collaborate with other people better, everyone needs to be a part of the project and that can be hard. Sometimes you have to swallow your pride and realize their idea is important too.



### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

  Your answer: You have to import the css file into the html

  Researched answer: There are three ways of inserting a style sheet: External CSS, Internal CSS, Inline CSS. An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags. An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.







2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

  Your answer: The div should be used on big parts of code while spans should be used on smaller parts.
  Researched answer: div is a block element, span is an inline element. This means that to use them semantically, divs should be used to wrap sections of a document, while spans should be used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.




3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

  Your answer: id if only used once, class with multiple

  Researched answer: CSS class is a selector to assign class name either one or group of element and apply specific styles.This difference is important to know where is use CSS ID and CSS Class. Because both work are same. CSS ID is a use for "unique identifier an element". It means CSS ID selector can be called only one times in a document while class selector can be called multiple times in a document. But you can use Class have a maximum flexibility.


4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

  Your answer: <header>, <footer>, <main>, <audio>.
